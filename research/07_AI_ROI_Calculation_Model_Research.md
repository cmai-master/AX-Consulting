## ROI Calculation Methodologies

### Standard ROI Formula

```
ROI (%) = [(Total Financial Gain - Total Investment Cost) / Total Investment Cost] × 100
```

**Alternative Formulation:**
```
ROI (%) = (Net Benefit / Total Cost) × 100
```

**Example:**
- Total Investment: $200,000
- Annual Financial Gain: $300,000
- Net Benefit: $100,000
- ROI = ($100,000 / $200,000) × 100 = 50%

### Net Present Value (NPV)

**Formula:**
```
NPV = Σ [Cash Flow_t / (1 + r)^t] - Initial Investment

Where:
- Cash Flow_t = Net cash flow in period t
- r = Discount rate
- t = Time period
```

**Interpretation:**
- NPV > 0: Investment creates value
- NPV < 0: Investment destroys value
- NPV = 0: Break-even investment

**Example:**
- Initial Investment: $500,000
- Annual Cash Flows: $150,000 (Years 1-5)
- Discount Rate: 10%
- NPV = $150K/(1.1)¹ + $150K/(1.1)² + ... + $150K/(1.1)⁵ - $500K
- NPV = $568,618 - $500,000 = $68,618

### Internal Rate of Return (IRR)

**Definition:**
The discount rate that makes NPV equal to zero.

**Formula:**
```
0 = Σ [Cash Flow_t / (1 + IRR)^t] - Initial Investment
```

**Interpretation:**
- If IRR > Cost of Capital: Accept investment
- If IRR < Cost of Capital: Reject investment
- Higher IRR indicates better investment

**Decision Rule:**
- Compare IRR to company's hurdle rate
- Select projects with IRR exceeding required return

### Payback Period

**Simple Payback Formula:**
```
Payback Period = Total Investment Cost / Annual Financial Gain
```

**Example:**
- Investment: $100,000
- Annual Savings: $25,000
- Payback Period = 4 years

**Discounted Payback Period:**
Accounts for time value of money by discounting cash flows.

**Interpretation:**
- Shorter payback periods preferred
- Reduces risk exposure
- Improves cash flow
- Typically target: 1-3 years for AI projects

### Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)

**TCO Components:**
```
TCO = Initial Costs + Operating Costs + Maintenance Costs - Residual Value

Where:
- Initial Costs: Development, infrastructure, implementation
- Operating Costs: Personnel, licenses, infrastructure (annual)
- Maintenance Costs: Updates, support, optimization (annual)
- Residual Value: Salvage or reusable value at end of life
```

**TCO vs. ROI:**
- TCO provides complete cost picture
- Essential for comparing alternatives
- Prevents underestimating true costs
- Foundation for accurate ROI calculation

ROAI = (AI-Driven Revenue + Cost Savings - AI Investment) / AI Investment × 100
```

**2. Incremental Revenue Attribution**
```
Incremental Revenue = (Revenue_with_AI - Revenue_without_AI) × AI Attribution %
```

**3. Cost Avoidance Value**
```
Cost Avoidance = (Previous Cost per Unit × Volume) - (AI Cost per Unit × Volume)
```

**4. Productivity Gain Value**
```
Productivity Value = Hours Saved × Hourly Rate × Number of Employees
```

**5. Error Reduction Value**
```
Error Value = (Error Rate_before - Error Rate_after) × Cost per Error × Volume
```

### Scenario Modeling

**Three-Scenario Approach:**

1. **Best Case (Optimistic)**
   - Maximum adoption
   - Fastest implementation
   - Highest benefits
   - Lowest unexpected costs

2. **Base Case (Most Likely)**

Expected ROI = (P_best × ROI_best) + (P_base × ROI_base) + (P_worst × ROI_worst)

Typical Probabilities:
- Best: 20%
- Base: 60%
- Worst: 20%
```

### Risk-Adjusted ROI

**Formula:**
```
Risk-Adjusted ROI = Expected ROI - (Risk Premium × Volatility)

Where:

- Risk Premium: Required return for risk level
- Volatility: Standard deviation of outcomes
```

**Example Risk Scenarios:**

**Scenario 1: Conservative**
- Investment: $100,000
- Best Case ROI: 80% (20% probability)
- Base Case ROI: 50% (60% probability)
- Worst Case ROI: 10% (20% probability)
- Expected ROI = 0.2(80%) + 0.6(50%) + 0.2(10%) = 48%

**Scenario 2: Aggressive**
- Investment: $500,000
- Best Case ROI: 200% (15% probability)
- Base Case ROI: 100% (50% probability)
- Worst Case ROI: -20% (35% probability)
- Expected ROI = 0.15(200%) + 0.5(100%) + 0.35(-20%) = 73%

### Value at Risk (VaR)

**Definition:**
Maximum expected loss at a given confidence level.

**Application to AI Projects:**
